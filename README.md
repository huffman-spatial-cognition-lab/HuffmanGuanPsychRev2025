# Code for Huffman and Guan (2025)
Our code for this project exists within several separate repositories, thus this repository contains links to the code from Huffman and Guan (2025, Psychological Review). We will update this repository shortly with the links for each of the projects.

If you use any of the ideas or code from any of this work, please cite our paper:\
Huffman, D. J., & Guan, R. J. (2024). Computational models suggest that human memory judgments exhibit interference due to the use of overlapping representations. *Psychological Review*.

## Part 1: Quantification of target-lure similarity within an artificial neural network
### Simulated pattern similarity in area IT (CORnet-S) and comparison to behavior (Figure 6)

## Part 2: Comparison of predictions from the computational models
### Overlapping distributed memory models (e.g., MINERVA 2, TODAM; Figures 7, 8, 11, 12, 13, and 17):

### Hopfield/autoassociative neural network (Figures 9 and 10):

## Part 3: Behavioral experiment
Note that we cannot share the behavioral data at this time because we do not have IRB permission. However, if you are interested please let us know, and we will check with our IRB for approval to share the data.

## Part 4: Further investigation of the overlapping distributed memory models and the CLS hippocampal model
### Overlapping distributed memory models
#### Linear version of MINERVA 2 + Replotting of TODAM to match spread of behavioral data (Figures 21 and 22)
